# General Info
An addon for Advanced Company featuring a variety of randomly found and compiled models tuned to *(hopefully)* work together nicely.

**!** This mod is originally designed to work with **LCv49** and **Advanced Company v1.1.1**. 

*Most of the models used are not mine and are not intended for commercial use.  
If there's a model of yours that you want to be removed, contact me through **Issues** on GitHub.*

## More Info
The future updates of this mod are aimed to connect various types of cosmetic gears, allowing players to customize their characters in multiple ways. Some accessories are designed for better immersion, while others are added purely for fun, so be creative.  
*Any ideas are  welcome. Feel free to share them in a separate topic within the **Issues** tab.*
